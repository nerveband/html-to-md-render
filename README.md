## FAQ

### Why use Jina Reader vs other HTML to Markdown solutions?

While there are many HTML to Markdown converters available, Jina Reader offers several unique advantages:

1. **Smart Content Extraction**: Unlike basic HTML scrapers, Jina Reader uses advanced algorithms to identify and extract the main content, removing clutter like ads, navigation, and footers.

2. **Image Support**: Jina Reader can automatically generate captions for images using AI, making the content more accessible and informative.

3. **Flexible Output**: Beyond just Markdown, you can get the content in various formats including HTML, plain text, or even screenshots.

4. **Reliability**: Jina Reader handles dynamic content, JavaScript-rendered pages, and complex layouts that often break traditional converters.

5. **API Integration**: Built on a production-grade API with high availability and scalability.

### Can I customize the keyboard shortcuts?

Yes! You can customize the keyboard shortcuts by:
1. Going to Chrome's Extensions page (chrome://extensions)
2. Clicking "Keyboard shortcuts" at the bottom
3. Finding "HTML to MD Render" and setting your preferred shortcut
